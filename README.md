# iOS Daydream Controller Demo

This is a Unity project to demo the updates in my gvr-unity-sdk PR to add iOS Daydream controller support. In this repo's history, you'll see the following commits:

- creation of a new project using Unity 2017.2.1f
- import of GVR Unity SDK 1.120.0
- addition of the changes from my PR to add iOS Daydream controller support to the HelloVR demo scene

To try out this demo, build the HelloVR scene for iOS and press a button on your Daydream controller to wake it up. The app will automatically connect to it and switch from the gaze pointer to the Daydream controller.
